# Person Search Extension

This extension includes the primary artifact card. An example target page is included as the person-search-target directory and it is uploaded separately if needed. The PersonSearch card is an Experience "template" card. Each instance of the card is configured individually, allowing for the creation of person search cards targeted at different populations within the ERP.

The interaction between the Experience card with Ethos is as diagramed.
